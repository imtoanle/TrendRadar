        When encountering configuration problems, **please describe your problem in as much detail as possible** and upload screenshots of configuration files and error messages. This will help locate and solve problems faster.

        It is recommended to first check the project documentation, as most common problems are explained in detail.

        ### 📋 Configuration problem self-check checklist (recommended reading before asking)

        #### 1️⃣ **Check documentation first** 📚
        Most configuration problems are explained in detail in the documentation. It is recommended to check the relevant sections first:
        - [🚀 Quick start](https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar#-快速开始)
        - [📝 frequency_words.txt configuration](https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar#frequencywordstxt-配置教程)
        - [🐳 Docker deployment guide](https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar#-docker-部署)
        - [🤖 AI analysis configuration](https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar#-ai-智能分析部署)

        #### 2️⃣ **Common misconceptions in testing push** ⚠️
        When testing message push, please check the following configurations:

        **Required configuration items:**
        - ❌ **Wrong**: `report.mode` set to `incremental` (incremental mode only pushes when there is new content)
        - ✅ **Correct**: `report.mode` set to `daily` or `current`
        - ❌ **Wrong**: `notification.push_window.enabled` set to `true` (push time window will limit push time)
        - ✅ **Correct**: `notification.push_window.enabled` set to `false` (recommended to disable during testing)

        **Explanation:**
        - Push time window control is an optional feature. When enabled, it only pushes within the specified time range
        - If the current time is not within the set window range, push messages will not be received
        - It is recommended to disable this feature first during testing

        #### 3️⃣ **YAML format is very strict** 📏
        The 3 most common errors in configuration files:
        ```yaml
        # ❌ Wrong example 1: incorrect indentation (must use spaces, not tabs)
        notification:
        enable_notification: true  # ← Error: missing indentation

        # ❌ Wrong example 2: no space after colon
        enable_notification:true  # ← Error: need space after colon

        # ✅ Correct example:
        notification:
          enable_notification: true  # ← Correct: 2-space indentation + space after colon
        ```

        #### 4️⃣ **Prepare information based on deployment method** 📦

        **If you are using GitHub Actions deployment:**
        1. **Must provide** Actions workflow link (format: `https://github.com/your-username/TrendRadar/actions/workflows/crawler.yml`)
        2. **How to view and screenshot execution logs:**
           ```
           Step 1: Open your repository, click the "Actions" tab at the top
           Step 2: Click the "Crawler" workflow on the left
           Step 3: Click the most recent run record (the top one)
           Step 4: Click to expand the "Run crawler" step
           Step 5: Screenshot the complete log content (especially the red error parts)
           ```
        3. Provide `config.yaml` configuration content (remember to hide webhook URLs)

        **If you are using Docker deployment:**
        1. Provide project directory structure screenshot (run `ls -la` or open file manager)
        2. Provide Docker logs (run `docker logs container_name`)
        3. Provide container status (run `docker ps -a`)
        4. Provide `.env` file content (hide sensitive information)

        **If you are running locally:**
        1. Provide complete error message screenshots
        2. Provide `config.yaml` configuration content
        3. Provide Python version (run `python --version`)

        #### 5️⃣ **Suggestions when encountering difficulties** 🤔
        - If you still have no progress after trying for more than 30 minutes, it is recommended to consider changing your approach
        - You can try:
          1. Re-read the relevant documentation sections from the beginning
          2. Try other deployment methods (such as switching from Docker to GitHub Actions)
          3. Compare with documentation examples and check for differences

        #### 6️⃣ **Please provide the following information when asking questions** 📋
        To help you locate problems faster, it is recommended to provide:
        - ✅ Configuration file content (please hide sensitive information such as webhooks)
        - ✅ Complete error log screenshots
        - ✅ Deployment method (local run/Docker/GitHub Actions)
        - ✅ Solutions you have already tried
        - ✅ Specific problem phenomena (please avoid just saying "not working" or "no response", try to describe specific manifestations)
